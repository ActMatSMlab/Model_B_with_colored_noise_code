# Model_B_with_colored_noise_code
This repository contains the source code used to simulate the system described by Model B with colored noise, as presented in the accompanying paper.
In this work, we model the effects of active particles on passive colloidal particles in an active–passive mixture. The influence of the active particles on the passive ones is represented as a spatiotemporally correlated colored noise. 

The theoretical background for generating the spatiotemporally correlated colored noise is described in : https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.46.4670

The simulation is implemented in Fortran 77. The spatiotemporally correlated colored noise is generated by solving a reaction–diffusion equation. A Gaussian white noise field is first generated using the standard gasdev subroutine from Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77, and then filtered to obtain the desired spatiotemporal correlations.

****Included Codes****

(i)  snapshot_code.f  -   Generates snapshots of the evolving field for use in producing figures and animation sequences for the manuscript.

(ii) correlation_code.f - Computes the two-point correlation function and the structure factor using the hardened variable and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods.
